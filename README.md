# Roiable
Onboarding task from Roiable. 
This was an IDM(Identity Manager) project given to me as an onboarding task.

This IDM project is a REST based product which is used to simplify the organization of employee identities and managing roles and privileges. With the current release the following functionalities are available:

⦁	Creation and management of employees

⦁	Creation and management of roles and privileges

⦁	Assigning, managing and removing access from the employees

The classes are structured around the Façade design pattern. SYBASE is used as a database and its accessed using data source.

More information about the project can be found in the documentation below.
